            <h5 class="h5-about">Learn more about Unity</h5>
            <p class="p-about">In a small room in a local shelter, Unity was originally founded in 1985 as Health Care
                  for the Homeless Project (HCHP). HCHP provided primary health care services to homeless individuals
                  and families that resided in local emergency shelters or on the streets of the District of Columbia.
                  In 1997, HCHP officially changed its name to Unity Health Care as services were expanded from not only
                  serving people experiencing homelessness, but to providing primary and specialty care to all District
                  residents. Over the past three decades we have grown into a network of over 20 traditional and
                  non-traditional health centers and a walking medical outreach program.</p>
