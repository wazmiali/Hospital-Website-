                  <p class="main1 text-small covid2p">After more than three years of facing the COVID-19 pandemic
                        head-on, Unity
                        wants to remind our patients and community that the future of this disease remains uncertain.
                        While the situation has improved, there is still a significant risk of contracting the virus,
                        particularly for those who are unvaccinated, people aged 65 and over, and those with chronic
                        medical conditions or who are immunosuppressed. We encourage everyone to stay vigilant by
                        keeping up-to-date with vaccinations, practicing good hygiene, and following public health
                        guidelines. Unity is committed to providing ongoing support and resources to help protect our
                        community's health. Together, we can navigate these challenges and work towards a safer,
                        healthier future.

                        Health Equity</p>
                  <p class="main1 text-small covid3text">Throughout all phases of the District’s pandemic response,
                        Unity
                        has played a pivotal role in combating COVID-19 in communities disproportionately affected by
                        severe illness and death from the virus. As a cornerstone of care within these communities,
                        Unity was uniquely poised to serve as a vaccine distribution partner for the District,
                        championing equitable access to vaccination opportunities for all residents.<br>
                  <p class="main1 text-small">
                        In 2021, the success of our team-based care model was evident as we took a leading role in the
                        city’s pandemic response. Our dedicated team mobilized to provide cutting-edge COVID-19 testing,
                        contact tracing, vaccinations, and treatment for our patients. We collaborated with various city
                        agencies and organizations, including the Department of Health, Department of Human Services,
                        Department of Corrections, DC Primary Care Association, and other Federally Qualified Health
                        Centers. These partnerships ensured that our patients and District residents had the necessary
                        information to make informed decisions about the COVID-19 vaccine and treatment options. We
                        proudly hosted mass vaccination events across the city, ensuring access to this lifesaving
                        intervention for all District residents.</p><br>
                  <p class="main1 text-small">
                        In 2022, Unity continued to live its mission of reaching people wherever they are, particularly
                        supporting those experiencing homelessness. In January 2022, in partnership with the Department
                        of Human Services (DHS), we established new Isolation and Quarantine sites to address the
                        heightened needs from the Coronavirus pandemic and support individuals with the Mpox virus.
                        Through Unity’s 340B in-house pharmacy program, providers prescribed and delivered medications
                        on the same day patients arrived at a Unity site. Unity also supported the city’s Pandemic
                        Emergency Program for Medically Vulnerable Individuals (PEP-V), providing site-wide testing and
                        vaccines across the District’s low-barrier shelter sites.</p><br>
                  <p class="main1 text-small">
                        We continue to witness the residual impacts of the pandemic, including heightened mental and
                        behavioral health challenges, increased substance use disorders, and the effects of delayed
                        preventative care. Our entire organization remains committed to advancing health equity,
                        addressing these challenges head-on with the dignity and respect we strive to provide for our
                        patients and each other every day.</p><br>

                  <p class="main1 text-small">
                        Looking ahead, Unity is expanding its outreach initiatives to include mental health support
                        programs and substance use recovery services, ensuring comprehensive care for all community
                        members. We are also enhancing our telehealth services to provide greater accessibility and
                        convenience for our patients. This is where our focus is moving forward, as we continue to
                        navigate the post-pandemic landscape and work towards a healthier future for all.</p>
